# Thumbnail Builder Design Plan

## Goal Description
Design a premium, standalone SaaS application called **Thumbnail Builder**, powered by Title Tester Pro v8. The goal is to create a high-fidelity visual design for a "pro-level" YouTube thumbnail creation tool that feels like a serious designer's workspace (Figma/Photoshop) rather than a toy.

## Visual Direction
- **Aesthetic**: Dark mode, neon-gradient accents (orange/purple/blue), blueprint/grid background textures.
- **DNA**: Inherits "Title Tester Pro v8" style but stands alone.
- **Logo**: Stylized camera frame / play button / face silhouette in neon line art.
- **Typography**: Clean, modern sans-serif (Inter/Roboto/Outfit).

## Proposed Screens & Components

### 1. Brand Identity
- **Logo**: New mark for Thumbnail Builder.
- **Badge**: "Powered by Title Tester Pro v8" using the rocket/monitor icon.

### 2. App Shell
- **Navigation**: Top bar with Logo, Sections (Dashboard, Create, Library, Presets, Account), User Profile.
- **Layout**: Consistent container with glowing rounded cards.

### 3. Dashboard / Landing
- **Hero**: "Design Viral Thumbnails in Minutes" with tilted 3D mockup.
- **Features**: 3 key cards (Face-Locked, Niche-Driven, Test Anywhere).
- **Recent Sessions**: Data table with status indicators.

### 4. Create Flow (The Core)
A 6-step wizard with a fixed left stepper and bottom action bar.
- **Step 1 (Face)**: Upload area, face gallery, pro tips.
- **Step 2 (Video)**: URL input vs Channel tab, video metadata preview.
- **Step 3 (Style)**: Niche grid, Style Preset carousel (realistic mockups), Inspiration upload.
- **Step 4 (Brief)**: Chat-like interface for instructions, quick chips, summary panel.
- **Step 5 (Thumbnails)**: Generation grid, detail view with variations (More Emotion, Less Text).
- **Step 6 (Export)**: Download options, "Send to Testing" (Title Tester Pro integration).

### 5. Secondary Screens
- **Library**: Grid of past variants with filters.
- **Presets**: Saved styles management.

## Verification Plan
- **Visual Check**: Ensure designs match the "Title Tester Pro v8" aesthetic provided in reference images.
- **Completeness**: Verify all 6 steps of the Create flow are represented.
- **User Review**: Present generated images for user feedback.
